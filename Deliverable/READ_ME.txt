Hi Daniel, just quick clarification for the additional files in this folder.

1. The landing page for Streamlit is "ðŸ’»Homepage.py", as we used multipages in the assignment. The rest of the pages are, of course, in the pages folder.

2. "my_streamlit_functions.py" is a collection of functions used adequatly prepared for its later use in streamlit related files. Its just a middle file where to define functions.

That's it :)
